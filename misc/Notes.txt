The Great Machine Plan:
	Black box style game,
	Levels get more complicated
	(story) Work towards figuring out what "The Great Machine" is,
	(GamePlay) Duplicate the black box circuit?
	
Idea (circuits):
	Start with simple Button/Switch input, LED output
	on more complex levels, unlock more complex components, (signal generators, bus inputs (numbers))
	Example levels:
		Digital:
		 - Simple Logic Gates
		 - Progres onto adders, multipliers etc.
		 - TGM (final level): 
		Analog:
		 - OpAmp circuits? (may be more complex)
		 - Controllers?
		 - TGM (final level): 



we could do something similar (Simple ISA) for later levels of this game, but space/implementation might be very difficult
although i was thinking adder/subtractor for a BlackBox challenge
so 1 bit as a controll signal, 4-8 bit inputs
another idea could be, (back to non-linear levels) when you complete a level (or maybe just the simpler ones) you unlock a component that is that level's circuit
so if there is a multiplexer circuit, after completing that level, you get a multiplexer circuit
that you can use to solve the other levels
